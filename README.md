# Zero-shot learning for substance use text analysis

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ltu-capr/zsl-text-tutorial/blob/master/ZSL_for_substance_use_text_analysis.ipynb)


## Synopsis

The notebook in this repository
guides you through applying zero-shot learning
to text data in substance use research.

It is a companion to
[our tutorial article](#citation),
which you should read for more details.


## Setup

There are two ways of running the notebook:
_online_, and _offline_.
The online version is easy to get started with
and is a great way to begin experimenting with our sample data.
However, if you have your own sensitive data
you should set up a software environment on your computer
and run the notebook offline
with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).

### Online (Google Colab)

[Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ltu-capr/zsl-text-tutorial/blob/master/ZSL_for_substance_use_text_analysis.ipynb)
to run the notebook online
using Google's free Colab service.
If you want to save changes to the notebook,
you will need to save a copy
in your own Google Drive.

### Offline (Jupyter Notebook)

To run the notebook offline,
you will need to install Python and Jupyter.
The easiest way to do this
is by [downloading and installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download),
which bundles Python and Jupyter together
in a single installer.

Once you have Python and Jupyter installed,
download this repository
and open `ZSL_for_substance_use_text_analysis.ipynb`
(the notebook file)
in Jupyter Notebook.
